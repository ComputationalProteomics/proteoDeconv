\title{Update gene symbols in a matrix to approved HGNC nomenclature}
\usage{
update_gene_symbols(data, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix containing gene expression or protein abundance data
with gene identifiers as row names.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print detailed messages about
the number of approved, non-approved, and unmappable gene symbols. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A matrix with updated gene symbols as row names. Rows with unmappable symbols
(where no suggested symbol could be found) are removed from the output.
}
\description{
This function checks and updates gene symbols in a matrix's row names to ensure they
conform to the current approved HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) standards.
Non-standard or outdated gene symbols are replaced with their current official symbols.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{HGNChelper} package to check and standardize gene symbols
based on a predefined gene symbols map. This is important for
ensuring consistency in gene naming across datasets and avoiding issues with outdated
or non-standard gene symbols.
