\title{Map column names to cell type groups using regex patterns}
\usage{
map_cell_groups(
  column_names,
  mapping_rules,
  default_group = "Unknown",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{column_names}{A character vector of column names to be mapped to cell type groups.}

\item{mapping_rules}{A named list where names are the target cell type groups and values
are character vectors of regex patterns that identify columns belonging to each group.}

\item{default_group}{A string that represents the default group name for columns not matching
any pattern. Default is "Unknown".}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints mapping process messages showing which columns were
mapped to which groups and which columns remained unmapped. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A character vector with the same length as \code{column_names}, containing the mapped
cell type group for each column name. Columns that don't match any pattern will be
assigned the \code{default_group}.
}
\description{
Maps a character vector of column names to predefined cell type categories by matching
against regex patterns.
}
\details{
This function iterates through the \code{mapping_rules} list and attempts to match
each column name against the regex patterns for each cell type group. The first matching group
in the order of the list will be assigned. The function is case-insensitive by default.

\examples{
# Example column names from a dataset
cols <- c("CD8_T_cell_donor1", "cd8_tcell_donor2", "NK_cell_sample3",
          "b_cell_healthy", "Bcell_patient", "monocyte_001", "unknown_cell")

# Define mapping rules for cell types
mapping <- list(
  "T_cell" = c("cd8.*t.*cell", "t.*cell"),
  "NK_cell" = c("nk.*cell", "natural.*killer"),
  "B_cell" = c("b.*cell")
)

# Map column names to cell types
cell_types <- map_cell_groups(cols, mapping)
print(data.frame(column = cols, cell_type = cell_types))
