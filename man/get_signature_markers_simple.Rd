\title{Get signature markers using simple threshold method}
\usage{
get_signature_markers_simple(
  Y,
  signature_mat,
  min_expression = 1000,
  min_fold_change = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of bulk data with gene identifiers as row names.}

\item{signature_mat}{A numeric matrix of signature marker values with gene identifiers as row names
and cell types as columns.}

\item{min_expression}{Minimum expression level required in the target cell type (default: 1000).}

\item{min_fold_change}{Minimum fold change required compared to other cell types (default: 3).}
}
\value{
A character matrix of markers with columns for cell type, comparison cell type, and gene name.
}
\description{
Extracts unique signature markers from a signature matrix using a simple threshold-based approach.
A gene is considered a marker if its expression in one cell type exceeds its expression
in other cell types by a specified fold change and meets a minimum expression threshold.
